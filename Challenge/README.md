# OVERVIEW
  As a huge cohort of baby boomers begin to retire, Pewlett-Hackard is looking to future proof itself by planning ahead for this upcoming change. PH wants to determine the list of retiring employees eligible for a retirement package and the number of vacancies that have to be filled in. They would also like to hand pick few of these qualified retiring employees and see if they would be interested to participate in a Mentorship program for the new employees. 

# RESULTS 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* "Senior Engineer"	29414
"Senior Staff"	28254
* 1549 eligible for Mentorship program

# SUMMARY 
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
