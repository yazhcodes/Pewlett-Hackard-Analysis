# OVERVIEW
  As a huge cohort of baby boomers begin to retire, Pewlett-Hackard is looking to future proof itself by planning ahead for this upcoming change. PH wants to determine the list of retiring employees eligible for a retirement package and the number of vacancies that have to be filled in. They would also like to hand pick few of these qualified retiring employees and see if they would be interested to participate in a Mentorship program for the new employees. 

# RESULTS 
* Dev, Prod, Sales have the most number of retiring employees; Marketing, HR, Finance have least number of retiring employees.
* Out of 41380 retiring employees, 1549 are eligible for Mentorship program

* A significantly high number of Senior Engineers and Senior Staffs are retiring compared to lower designations like Manager and Asst. Engineer.
* A mere 1000+ senior employees are eligible for Mentorship program, so it is vital to offer them the best benefits and retain them for a smooth transition.
