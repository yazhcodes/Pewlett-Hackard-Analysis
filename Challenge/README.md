# OVERVIEW
  As a huge cohort of baby boomers begin to retire, Pewlett-Hackard is looking to future proof itself by planning ahead for this upcoming change. PH wants to determine the list of retiring employees eligible for a retirement package and the number of vacancies that have to be filled in. They would also like to hand pick few of these qualified retiring employees and see if they would be interested to participate in a Mentorship program for the new employees. 

# RESULTS 
* Development, Production and Sales have the most number of retiring employees; Marketing, HR and Finance have the least number of retiring employees.
* Out of 72,458 retiring employees, only 1,549 are eligible for Mentorship program.

* A significantly high number of Senior Engineers and Senior Staffs are retiring compared to lower designations like Manager and Assistant Engineer.
* Around 1000+ senior employees are eligible for Mentorship program, so it is vital to offer them the best benefits and retain them for a smooth transition.

# SUMMARY
* As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, 70,909 vacancies will open up in Pewlett-Hackard!
* There are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employee. In order to bridge this gap, PH has to relax its criteria for picking mentors. Currently they are considering only employees hired in 1965. If it were increased by a few more years, PH would have enough mentors to guarantee a smooth transition.
